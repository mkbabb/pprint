///
/// This function takes a list of document lengths and a maximum line width, and returns a vector
/// of indices that represent the end of each line in the justified text. The algorithm minimizes
/// the "badness" of each line, which is defined as the cube of the unused space at the end of the
/// line.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `sep_length` - The length of the separator between words.
/// * `doc_lengths` - A vector of the lengths of each word in the document.
/// * `max_width` - The maximum line width.
///
/// # Returns
///
/// A vector of indices that represent the end of each line in the justified text.
